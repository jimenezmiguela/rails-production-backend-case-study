# Production Rails Backend Case Study

## Overview

Over a two-year period, I contributed to the backend of a production Ruby on Rails application used by nonprofit organizations to coordinate outreach operations.

The platform supported both mobile and web users and enabled teams to:

- Plan and navigate to field locations
- Track outreach visits
- Manage structured records
- Enforce role-based user permissions

This case study outlines my backend contributions and production engineering experience within a multi-developer Rails environment.

## Team & Development Environment

- Team of 12 developers
- Agile (Scrum) methodology
- 2-week sprint cycles
- Daily standups
- Sprint demos and retrospectives
- Jira-based ticket management
- Structured pull request review workflow

All work was performed within an established, actively maintained production codebase serving real organizational users.

## Backend Contributions

### Mapping & External Routing API Integration

The application included a mapping and navigation system used to coordinate field visits.

My responsibilities included:

- Resolving tickets related to route generation and navigation behavior
- Improving integration with an external routing API within Rails services
- Modifying backend logic for storing and updating location data
- Ensuring consistency between mapped data and persisted records
- Refactoring service logic for clarity and maintainability

This required careful handling of third-party API responses and production-safe updates.

---

### REST API Development

The platform relied on structured API endpoints to support filtering, searching, and sorting across multiple features.

My work included:

- Creating and modifying RESTful endpoints
- Implementing dynamic search and filtering logic
- Supporting sortable attributes across complex datasets
- Maintaining consistent parameter handling
- Preserving backward compatibility while extending functionality

Changes were implemented with regression safety and long-term maintainability in mind.

### PostgreSQL Data Integrity & Migrations

Working within a live production database required careful coordination.

Responsibilities included:

- Writing Rails migrations for schema updates
- Validating and sanitizing inconsistent legacy data
- Implementing model-level validations
- Following production-safe migration practices

Data integrity and deployment safety were treated as first-class concerns.

---

### Testing & Regression Safety

Improving system stability was a consistent focus.

I:

- Wrote RSpec tests for new backend features
- Expanded coverage for critical workflows
- Reduced regression risk in high-usage areas
- Verified API behavior and authentication flows

Testing was approached as long-term system protection rather than simple coverage metrics.

---

### Security & Authentication Hardening

The system required secure account management and role-based access control.

My contributions included:

- Implementing account locking after repeated failed login attempts
- Revising account confirmation workflows
- Refining permission levels across user roles
- Strengthening authentication-related logic

These improvements enhanced both system security and operational reliability.

## Production Engineering Experience

Beyond feature development, this role provided hands-on experience with:

- Working within a large, established Rails codebase
- Coordinating changes across multiple developers
- Participating in structured code review workflows
- Delivering incremental improvements within sprint timelines
- Avoiding regressions in active production systems
- Balancing technical debt with feature delivery

---

## Summary

This experience strengthened my ability to:

- Safely modify production Rails systems
- Integrate third-party APIs
- Maintain database integrity
- Improve regression safety
- Contribute effectively within a team-based Agile environment

It informs how I now build, deploy, and maintain client-facing Rails applications with an emphasis on stability, clarity, and incremental delivery.
